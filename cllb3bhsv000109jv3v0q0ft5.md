Statistical tests serve as fundamental tools for data scientists to draw meaningful conclusions from data. They help validate hypotheses, uncover patterns, and make informed decisions. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the essential statistical tests that every data scientist should be well-versed in. We'll explore the assumptions, applications, advantages, limitations, and provide the mathematical foundations for each of these tests.
